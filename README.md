# InteractivePlotting
The following repository was created to allow You to quick review functions. There are some default mathematical functions provided (function and its derivative), however I created functions.py file for You to easy access, so You can edit them. 

Also there is an option to mark one point so You can compare both functions in same place.

# Running repository 
To run repository You need to have installed Python 3 with following libraries:
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib

If You are okey with above, all You need to do is open repository directory and type commend:
`bash`
$ python plotPython

Hope You enjoy it. ;)
